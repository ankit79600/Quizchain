# 🧠 On-Chain Quiz System (Solidity Project)

Welcome to the **On-Chain Quiz System** — a simple Solidity smart contract project that brings quiz logic directly **on the blockchain**!  
This project is designed for beginners who want to learn how to build decentralized applications (DApps) and understand how smart contracts store and verify data on-chain.  

---

## 📘 Project Description

This project demonstrates how to create and interact with an **on-chain quiz** where:
- The **quiz owner** can add verified questions and answers.
- **Players** can submit their answers directly through the blockchain.
- The contract automatically checks if the submitted answer is correct and stores the result permanently on-chain.

The idea is simple but powerful — turning traditional quizzes into **transparent, immutable, and fair** on-chain systems.

## ⚙️ What It Does

- The **owner** (deployer) adds new questions and verified answers.
- Users **submit answers** via a transaction.
- The contract checks if the answer matches the correct one and **stores the result**.
- Anyone can **view** whether a player’s answer was correct or not using the public functions.
