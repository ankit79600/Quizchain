Welcome to the **On-Chain Quiz System** — a simple Solidity smart contract project that brings quiz logic directly **on the blockchain**!  
This project is designed for beginners who want to learn how to build decentralized applications (DApps) and understand how smart contracts store and verify data on-chain.  

---

## 📘 Project Description

This project demonstrates how to create and interact with an **on-chain quiz** where:
- The **quiz owner** can add verified questions and answers.
- **Players** can submit their answers directly through the blockchain.
- The contract automatically checks if the submitted answer is correct and stores the result permanently on-chain.

The idea is simple but powerful — turning traditional quizzes into **transparent, immutable, and fair** on-chain systems.

---

## ⚙️ What It Does

- The **owner** (deployer) adds new questions and verified answers.
- Users **submit answers** via a transaction.
- The contract checks if the answer matches the correct one and **stores the result**.
- Anyone can **view** whether a player’s answer was correct or not using the public functions.

## ✨ Features

✅ Add questions (only owner access)  
✅ Submit answers directly on-chain  
✅ Automatic answer verification  
✅ Stores who answered correctly  
✅ Beginner-friendly and well-commented Solidity code  
✅ Perfect for learning smart contract development

Transaction Reference

A quick reference to the related transaction on the Celo Sepolia Blockscout explorer:

Transaction (Blockscout): 0x89ec478028e1e5b51574920403b2ace368f3b369b6632e5dd4982b6c1b005c3a

You can paste the above link directly into your repository's README to let others open the transaction in Blockscout.
